By default these files are assumed to be the vanilla ones downloaded as for 
example in OpenCV-3.0.0-android-sdk-1.zip. In this case copy from
OpenCV-3.0.0-android-sdk-1.zip:/ssd/Android/OpenCV-android-sdk/sdk/native/ to
jni/opencv/native.

Alternately it is possible to compile a version containing OpenCL support
(as at release date OpenCV for Android defaults to being compiled without OpenCL support). 
However benchmarking on a Nexus 7 2013 and a LG G2 revealed no performance
improvement, and on the LG was slower so the default in use uses the 
vanilla libs (possibly the number of GPU cores are low so when OpenGL is in
use and using shaders the number of cores left are to low to improve
performance. 

jni/cv/cv.cc will also needed to be edited with the UMat GPU version of
Java_to_augmented_reality_android_em_recorder_CV_SHIFT uncommented out
when testing a OpenCL version.

To compile the OpenCV libs the following steps may be followed::

Assumes OpenCV 3 source downloaded to /ssd/opencv-3.0.0/ (its a bit faster on
a SSD).

Uses ninja (https://martine.github.io/ninja/) for a faster build.

cd /ssd/opencv-3.0.0/platforms/
mkdir android-build
cd android-build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/ssd/opencv-3.0.0/platforms/android/android.toolchain.cmake -DANDROID_ABI="armeabi-v7a with NEON" -DCMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH=ON -DWITH_OPENCL=YES -DWITH_CUDA=NO -DWITH_EIGEN=NO -DWITH_IPP=NO /ssd/opencv-3.0.0/
ninja install/strip
(If using Windows you may need a -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM="\whatever\ninja.exe")

ninja install/strip

rsync -avz /ssd/opencv-3.0.0/platforms/android-build/install/sdk/native/ /path/to/checkedout/ARem/ARemRecorder/jni/opencv/native/

rm -rf *

Repeat above cmake with -DANDROID_ABI="x86" (it does not seem to support
multiple ABI's in one build).

and again for any other ABI eg arm64-v8a, x86-64 etc.

After building copy opencv/native/libs/{ABI}/libopencv_java3.so to
../libs/{ABI}.  libopencv_java3.must be explicitly loaded using 
System.loadLibrary in RecorderActivity (currently commented out)..
